# Spotify Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard analyzing Spotify's most streamed songs and artists, modeled after Spootify's UI.
The dashboard is designed to highlight music trend over time, artist dominance, and track popularity through interactive visuals.

## Why I Made This
I built this dashboard as a way to:
- Strengthen my skills in Power BI and data visualization
- Practce working with large datasets (over 900+ songs and multiple attributes)
- Learn how to use DAX measures, relationships, and interactivity to make insights more dynamic
- Prepare myself for future projects where I can combine data storytelling with business insights

This project was a hands-on learning experience, helping me improve both technical Power BI skills and my ability to communicate data-driven insights clearly.
